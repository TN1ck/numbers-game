# Numbers Game

This game is known under various names: Zahlenspiel, Numberama, Take Ten, Seeds or Numbers.
Here is an app that does the same: [Zahlenspiel](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kila.zahlenspielpro.lars&hl=de).

## Implementation

I wrote this app originally in the winter of 2014/2015 initially with jQuery, then I used it to learn rRact. In 2017 I modernized it, so it doesn't rot away. When you want to check out the older versions, you can find them in the branches. It's a nice piece of history.

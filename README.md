## Implementation

I wrote this app originally in the winter of 2014/2015 initially with jQuery, then I used it to learn React. In 2017 I modernized it, so it doesn't rot away. When you want to check out the older versions, you can find them in the branches. It's a nice piece of history.

## Development

Tested with node.js 22, but should run with previous version as well. See [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/en) for install instructions. If you have it installed, run `npm install` to install the dependencies and `npm start` for local development, it will start a server at port 3009 e.g. [http://localhost:3009](http://localhost:3009). Run `npm build` to create the production build.
